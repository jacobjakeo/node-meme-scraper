## Node Meme Scraper

Node Meme Scraper is a Command Line Interface application, that scrapes memes from https://memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app/.

After running the application, a new folder called "memes" will be created within the directory of the project.

10 first images scraped from the website will be saved inside this folder, and named accordingly with a number, eg. `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, etc.
